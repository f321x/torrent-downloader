This is the repository of a simple python bittorrent client using the libtorrent library for the torrent protocol and tkinter as gui framework.
The focus of this client lies in having a simple and readable codebase to experiment with the bittorrent protocol, so always favor simplicity over complex new code when feasible.
Always add type hints wherever possible and generously add asserts to the code so bugs will be noticed early.
Also implement new contained and useful unittests whenever feasible after doing changes. Unittests are very important.
After being done with changes always run the unittests with "pytest tests/" and verify they pass.
